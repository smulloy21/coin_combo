# _Coin Combo_

##### _Given input of needed change, app calculates smallest number of coins, 8/6/15_

#### By _** Brian Lau | Shannon Mulloy  **_

## Description

_On the form, input the amount of needed change, as a decimal. The app will calculate the most efficient use of coins to return the correct change.

Note: the till is set as having 5 quarters, 10 dimes, 20 nickels, and unlimited pennies. This can be changed in the coin_combo.rb file by changing the variables: num_q, num_d and num_n (and potentially setting a limit to pennies)._
